# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Testing the Project code

In the project directory (./course-project/src), you can run following scripts to test:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node server.js`

In this Project, the Express server is implemented in `server.js` which needs to be running before `npm start`.\
Please run this script BEFORE running `npm start` unless the app will not run successfully.

## `npm run build` (Only for deployment purpose)

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
